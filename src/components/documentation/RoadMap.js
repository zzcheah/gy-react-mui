# Road Map 🗺️

This section discuss on the Roadmap of the project and future work.

## To-do 📌

🎯 More Error Handling  

🎯 Improve UI - more information  

🎯 Add Mail Server - notify user through email

🎯 AMD GPU Support

🎯 Improve security

🎯 Serverless GPU Yard (separate project)



## Community-Driven 💪

This system allows the adding of new images (equivalent to how the task is processed). Hence, the system can be mpre powerful if supported by the community.

Anyone in the community can write script to be used in this system. New images (with possibly newer versions) can be added which keep the system relavent as time passes.



## Extensible Projects

While the scope of the project is binded to AI applications, it can be extended to meet other requirements as desired. 

The project proposes an idea on how things can be processed in a "Run-a-container as a Service" way. This project also showcases that the container can run in a GPU-accelerated environment which open up more possibilities with this architecture.

Below shows some potential projects that can based on the idea:


### Providing "Run-a-container as a Service"

Any organization with underutilized GPUs can set up such system to provide services to the public. In this way, the organization is able to gain addiional income from the underutilized GPUs.

### Go a step forward

Instead of using underutilized GPU, one can even rent machine on the cloud to set up such system to provide services as above. Note that this approach may incur losses.

// ## Potential/Example Use Cases

// This sub-section discusses on how this system can be used, focusing on the benifit of having GPU-accelerated environment.

// ### Learning Institutions

// learning institution can set up this system to provide MLaaS to the students.
// It will be helpful for the students that cannot afford a good GPU for machine learning tasks. Having this system in a learning institution can also encourage students to look more into the ML and AI fields.

// ### Organization

// Any organization can set up this system to share its underutilized GPU resources with its members.
